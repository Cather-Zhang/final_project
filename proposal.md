### Team Webinar Proposal ###
Project name: PushIt
Team members: Cather Zhang, Jordan Wecler, Mark Renzi

This is a game where a player can use direction buttons to traverse a game board in the shape of a grid, and push blocks with different pairs of colors. Once two blocks of the same color are pushed together, they are removed from the game board. Once all blocks are removed, the player wins the level (Number of moves will be tracked).

The player can login with their github account and a score board with number of moves of each player will be stored in database and displayed. (p.s. If we have more time, we will have another score board with least time to solve the game).

We will be using react for GUI, MongoDB for storing login and score data, Bulma for CSS framework, and express for server.
