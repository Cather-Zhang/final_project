1. [Project link](https://pushbox.glitch.me/)
  The project is called PushBox, where a player can login with their github account, and play the game. The purpose of the game is to remove all pairs of blocks with the same color. A player can control the little cat character to move to an empty space, to push a block to an empty space, and to remove blocks if they are pushed together. 
  
  Once the player starts moving, there is a timer to keep track of how long it takes to solve the puzzle. There is also a number of moves tag to keep track of number of moves it take to solve the puzzle. Once the puzzle is solved, the player can click "submit" to submit their scores.
